Expense Management System Data ModelThis data model defines the key entities and their relationships required to support the Multi-Level and Conditional Approval workflow as described in the problem statement. This structure demonstrates the "Good to Have" skill of designing backend APIs and modeling data.1. User (users collection)Stores user authentication, roles, and hierarchy.Field NameTypeDescriptionidStringUnique User ID (e.g., Firebase Auth UID)emailStringUser's email addressnameStringUser's full nameroleStringRole: Admin, Manager, or Employeemanager_idString / NullForeign key to the users table, identifying their direct manager. Null for top-level users (Admin/Directors).company_idStringForeign key to the companies table.2. Company (companies collection)Stores global configuration and default currency.Field NameTypeDescriptionidStringUnique Company IDnameStringCompany name (e.g., "Odoo Hackathon Inc.")base_currencyStringThe company's default currency (e.g., "USD", "EUR").admin_user_idStringForeign key to the users table for the primary admin.3. Expense Claim (claims collection)The core transaction representing a submitted expense.Field NameTypeDescriptionidStringUnique Expense Claim IDuser_idStringForeign key to the users table (who submitted the claim).dateDateDate the expense occurred.submitted_onTimestampDate/time the claim was submitted.descriptionStringDetailed description of the expense.categoryStringExpense category (e.g., Travel, Meals, Software).original_amountNumberThe amount in the currency of the expense.original_currencyStringThe currency of the expense (e.g., "GBP").base_amountNumberThe amount converted to the company's base_currency.statusStringCurrent status: Draft, Pending, Approved, Rejected, Paid.approval_flow_idStringForeign key to the approval_flows table used for this claim.current_approver_step_idStringID of the current step in the approval flow waiting for action.4. Approval Flow Definition (approval_flows collection)Defines the structure for multi-level and conditional routing.Field NameTypeDescriptionidStringUnique Flow IDnameStringName of the flow (e.g., "Standard Flow", "High-Value Flow").is_activeBooleanWhether this flow is currently in use.company_idStringForeign key to the companies table.stepsArray of ObjectsAn array containing all steps (see Approval Step Schema below).Approval Step Schema (within steps array)Field NameTypeDescriptionstep_idStringUnique ID for this step within the flow.sequenceNumberThe order in which steps must be executed.approver_typeStringMANAGER, ROLE, USER.approver_valueString / NullThe specific role or user ID required if approver_type is not MANAGER.is_conditionalBooleanIf true, the step is bypassed unless conditions are met.condition_rulesObject / NullDefines rules for conditional approval (e.g., {field: 'amount', operator: '>', value: 1000}).conditional_logicString / NullPERCENTAGE_RULE, SPECIFIC_RULE, or HYBRID_RULE.5. Approval History (approval_history collection)Records every action taken on an expense claim.Field NameTypeDescriptionidStringUnique history IDclaim_idStringForeign key to the claims table.approver_idStringForeign key to the users table (who approved/rejected).step_idStringThe ID of the flow step this action relates to.actionStringApproved, Rejected, Escalated, Auto-Approved.commentString / NullOptional comment from the approver.timestampTimestampDate/time the action occurred.
